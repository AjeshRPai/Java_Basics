	/**
	 * Size of data. The more bigger size of data => the greater speedup.
	 *
	 * Boxing/Unboxing. Primitive values are processed faster than boxed values.
	 *
	 * The number of cores are available at runtime. The more available cores => the greater speedup.
	 *
	 * Cost per element processing. The longer each element is processed => the more efficient parallelization.
	 * But it is not recommended to use parallel stream for performing too long operations (for example, network interconnection).
	 *
	 * Source data structure. Usually initial data source is a collection.
	 * The easier it is splited into parts => the greater speedup.
	 * For example, ArrayList, arrays and IntStream.range() constructor are good sources for data splitting because they support random access.
	 * Other, such as LinkedList, Stream.iterate are bad sources for data splitting.
	 *
	 * Type of operations: stateless or stateful.
	 * Stateless operations (examples: filter, map) are better for parallel processing than stateful operations (examples: distinct, sorted, limit).ï»¿
