//  Mediator design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern,

// Mediator design pattern is used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.

  Real world example of mediator pattern
      A great real world example of mediator pattern is traffic control room at airports.
      If all flights will have to interact with each other for finding which flight is going to land next, it will create a big mess.
      Rather flights only send their status to the tower.
      These towers in turn send the signals to conform which airplane can take-off or land.
      We must note that these towers do not control the whole flight. They only enforce constraints in the terminal areas.

      Another good example of mediator pattern is a chat application.
      In a chat application we can have several participants.
      Itâ€™s not a good idea to connect each participant to all the others because the number of connections would be really high.
      The best solution is to have a hub where all participants will connect; this hub is just the mediator class.


     In Java programming, the execute() method inside the java.util.concurrent.Executor interface follows this pattern.
     The different overloaded versions of various schedule() methods of the java.util.Timer class also can be considered to follow this pattern.
